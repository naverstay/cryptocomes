                        .article_preview iGaming platform provider Cash Bet has partnered with Arsenal Football Club in a deal that will promote the firm's new crypto token.

                        p The South Korean government announced today it will move to prohibit domestic cryptocurrency exchanges from allowing users to make transactions through anonymous accounts, local news sources report.

                        p As part of what appears to be a series of updates designed to improve oversight of industry practices, the government will also seek to bar banks from issuing new virtual accounts to cryptocurrency exchanges.

                        p According to the South Korean news agency Yonhap, the announcements were made by Hong Nam-ki, the minister of the Office for Government&nbsp;Policy Coordination, after discussion with vice ministers from other governmental bodies regarding the recent rise in cryptocurrency interest and ownership domestically.

                        p Hong’s announcement came just after an hour since the head of South Korea’s financial regulator warned against the bitcoin bubble during a meeting with the press.

                        p "I bet the bubble in bitcoin will burst later," said Choe Heung-sik, the governor of the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS).

                        p Hong told the news source that only accounts with real and matching identity can be allowed for deposit and withdrawals.

                        p The government's ban on using anonymous accounts, effectively a mandate that exchange providers perform know-your-customer (KYC) due diligence, is seen as the latest move to curb the trading activity around cryptocurrencies in the country.

                        p It can also be seen as the result of recent events in which government bodies were reportedly considering measures to halt what they called an "overheating of virtual currency speculation."

                        p According to the report, the Financial Intelligence Unit and the Financial Supervisory Service will implement the regulation and supervise exchanges to abide the new rule.
